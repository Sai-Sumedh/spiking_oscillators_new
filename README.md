# spiking_oscillators_new
Visualize the relation between coupling strength and settling phase of spiking-neuron oscillators

_snn_: A package for simulating any spiking neural network. It consists of classes for neurons, synapses and the network, and functions to compute time evolution of the network and for obtaining the frequency and phase of the oscillators as a function of time

Other files use the snn package and plot the characteristics of a single oscillator, and a pair of oscillators, including relations between settling phase (& settling time) and connectivity parameters
